#room booking

This is a very basic starting project for a room booking website which i made when i just started learning about backend and its usage.
To run the program node_modules are required and use split Terminals. Type "npm start" in one and in other "node server.js" it will redirect you to the webpage on local host 5000.
I have used express ,cors, axios and uuid for various usages.

In frontend there is no styling it is just a jsx code. YOu get 3 emplty fields with tags: Name, Purpose and Club you need to fill all otherwise it gives out error.
ot is will give out a message room booked
when you fill out all and click add the room will be booked and will be displayed.
Along with display you will have a delete button from which the room booking can be deleted at it gives the message "Room Deleted".
